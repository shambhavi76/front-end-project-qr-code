# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

This project helps in building a QR code component for developers following the Frontend Mentor challenge, to aid in better improvement of their front-end skill. In simple terms, it is a nice, interactive display of a QR code that is meant to be responsive and, therefore, look good on all the screen sizes. This task needs a good flow in both HTML and CSS, with major focuses on the use of CSS Grid and Flex for layout and design solutions.

It has a very basic yet nice user interface that displays a QR code, which the user is supposed to scan for them to be guided to a specified URL. Clean, simple, and quite minimalistic in functionality design, it's a real exercise for a developer aimed at pulling the coding technologies and responsive design into one piece of art best practice.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5: The <footer> element is used, improving the structure and accessibility of the page.
- CSS Grid: Applied within the .div class to align and center its content.
- Flexbox: Used on the body to center the .div and <footer> vertically and horizontally.
- Responsive Design: Ensured by the viewport meta tag.
- CSS Styling: Includes padding, border-radius, text alignment, and other visual styles.

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on responsive design and aim to incorporate more complex CSS Grid layouts in future projects. Additionally, I want to explore CSS animations to add interactive elements to my web pages.
